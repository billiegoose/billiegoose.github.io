# ATA Engineering, Inc.
San Diego, CA.<br>
Mar 29 - Sept 17, 2010 and Mar 30 - Sept 18, 2009

How I benefited ATA:
- Built finite element models, ran analyses, and post-processed results.
  - __Created clear presentations__ for customers explaining the results.
- Communicated closely with the sales team to determine and meet their needs.
  - Created an application to track software sales
- During down time, wrote new web-based tools to run on ATAâ€™s intranet:
  - An analysis server webpage that __saved engineers time__.
  - A WYSIWYG floor plan editor that made maintaining online floor plans __easy for HR__.
- Upgraded, customized and __enhanced__ ATA's software issue-reporting website and timesheet application.

# UC Simulation Center with Procter & Gamble.
Cincinnati, OH.<br>
Mar 29 - Sept 17, 2011

How I benefited P&G:
- Ported 15,000 lines of undocumented C++ code from 32-bit Windows to 64-bit Linux.
  - This __reduced simulation time__ and __simplified the simulation process__ by allowing the entire process run on their Linux cluster.
  - __Documented the code__, uncovering the equations and assumptions used by the model that was previously a black box.
- Wrote a proof-of-concept tool to import geometry from a proprietary design program into the simulation.
  - Laid the foundation for tighter collaboration between P&G designers and simulators.
