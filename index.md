**You are early! I'm still setting up.**

My plan is to migrate content from <https://sites.google.com/site/wmhilton/home> over here, since Github is the place to be these days. By June perhaps.

Meanwhile, perhaps you'd like to peruse some of my code projects over at [@wmhilton](https://github.com/wmhilton)?
