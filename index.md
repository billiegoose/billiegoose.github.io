**I'm a much better web developer than this site would suggest.** :smiley:
<br>I've just been working on cooler stuff than this site.

## What am I working on?

My two latest projects are extraordinary. They're not really ready for release (or even beta testing) but once they are, I'm going to write not just one, but a whole series of blog posts about them.

- [esgit](https://github.com/billiegoose/esgit) A fully working implementation of `git` in ECMAScript that also happens to work *in the browser*. (See next item!)
- [nde](https://nde.now.sh) Imagine Atom editor, but completely in client-side browser JavaScript, that you can use to develop your progressive web app. With hot-module reloading. And dynamic module loading (all of npm without the "npm install"). And full file system emulation, git, and Github integration! Oh, and did I mention it's self-hosted (you can edit the editor) and it caches everything offline with service workers?

Prior to that: Bare metal programming!
- Hardware! I got myself a [Nandland Go](https://www.nandland.com/goboard) FPGA board. Currently fiddling with I2C and SPI.
- Assembly! Check out the gif of [It-boots-but-that's-about-it OS](https://github.com/billiegoose/boots) booting and reading a file from disk(ette).
- C! Not technically bare metal, but my [dukboot](https://gitlab.com/dukboot/dukboot) project aims to build a tiny library OS around the [duktape](http://duktape.org) JS engine.

Prior to that, I was on a tooling binge. Check out:

- [update-readme](https://github.com/update-readme/update-readme) Auto-generate (and maintain!) your next README file
- [create-node-module](https://github.com/billiegoose/create-node-module#js) Refactor your code into lots of small modules, without the friction of set up that would slow you down
- [beautify](https://github.com/billiegoose/beautify) All code looks beautiful, once you've parsed its AST.

These tools are all hovering around the 90% complete stage. I'm saving that last 10% for a rainy weekend.

## What else?

- [webtorrent-button](https://github.com/billiegoose/download-with-webtorrent-button) Supercharge ordinary download links with WebTorrent P2P!
- [jus](https://github.com/jus/jus) I'm a contributor/maintainer
- [marky-markdown](https://github.com/npm/marky-markdown) I contributed the browserified bundle!
- [node-modules.io](https://node-modules.io) I maintain a site dedicated to npm alternatives and host my own registry mirror

## What about projects from college and earlier?

Check out [Projects](./projects/)!

## Do you ever get paid to build websites?

I do! Not all of them are still in existance. However, here are some recent commercial projects I've worked on that I'm proud of:

- [American Classical Music Walk of Fame Player](https://app.classicalwalkoffame.net/) is my first Progressive Web App.
Offline support, A2HS install banners, media session API for album art.
- [Online.Cars search](http://patent.online.cars/) Not originally my design, but I was lead developer for several months including a full rewrite in Vue.

## What's your secret master plan?

Elon Musk [had one](https://www.tesla.com/blog/secret-tesla-motors-master-plan-just-between-you-and-me).
My parents often wonder, [but I do have a plan](https://github.com/project-leibniz/master-plan).
(I also have a [5-year plan](https://github.com/billiegoose/modload#5-year-plan)!)


<hr>

My plan is to migrate content from <https://sites.google.com/site/billiegoose/home> over here, since Github is the place to be these days. That's been my plan since 2014 though so don't hold your breath. I should make that part of my 5-year plan.

Meanwhile, perhaps you'd like to peruse some of my code projects over at [@billiegoose](https://github.com/billiegoose)?
