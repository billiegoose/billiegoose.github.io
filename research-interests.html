<h2 id="past-research" class="deep-link"><a href="#past-research">Past Research:</a></h2>
<p>I was selected for an NSF-funded undergraduate research experience at the University of Cincinnati. I and two other students researched novel stereovision filtering, computer vision, and obstacle avoidance algorithms on UC&apos;s intelligent ground vehicles.</p>
<p>As a graduate student at Drexel University, I participated in the DARPA Robotics Challenge and developed experience with the Hubo humanoid robot.</p>

<h3 id="human-robot-interaction" class="deep-link"><a href="#human-robot-interaction">Human-robot interaction</a></h3>
<p>How can we ensure our robot-filled future is full of perceptive, helpful, friendly robots, rather than dumb, pesky, frustrating ones?</p>
<h4 id="why-im-no-longer-interested" class="deep-link"><a href="#why-im-no-longer-interested">Why I&apos;m no longer interested</a></h4>
<p>As of 2012-2014, the technology is just not mature/reliable enough to do meaningful experiments with humanoid robots.
The robots I had to work with were too dumb, pesky, frustrating for even <em>me</em> to put up with. And that&apos;s saying something.</p>
<h3 id="perception" class="deep-link"><a href="#perception">Perception</a></h3>
<p>How to make sense of the wealth of sensor data available to robots</p>
<h4 id="why-im-no-longer-interested-1" class="deep-link"><a href="#why-im-no-longer-interested-1">Why I&apos;m no longer interested</a></h4>
<p>Actually, it would still probably be a pretty interesting field. But frankly, it looks like
machine vision, 3D reconstruction from video, augmented reality physics, etc all seem
to be coming along just fine.</p>
<h3 id="machine-learning" class="deep-link"><a href="#machine-learning">Machine learning</a></h3>
<p>How to organize and apply knowledge</p>
<h4 id="why-im-no-longer-interested-2" class="deep-link"><a href="#why-im-no-longer-interested-2">Why I&apos;m no longer interested</a></h4>
<p>I&apos;m a machine learning hipster. I was into it before it was a buzzword.
After studying it for three years at university, I was kind of disappointed in a &quot;this is it?&quot; way.
Then deep neural nets took off, and the tools became so plug-and-play that everyone
and their dog can build an &quot;app&quot; that uses machine learning. While neural nets do indeed organize
knowledge, to date the ML field has been obsessed with results/performance,
without concerning itself with <em>understanding</em> how these nets are organizing that knowledge.
It is a very shallow victory.</p>
<h3 id="machine-ethics" class="deep-link"><a href="#machine-ethics">Machine ethics</a></h3>
<p>What do we tell cognitive agents about how to behave? Can we define or enforce ethical robot / AI behavior?</p>
<h4 id="why-im-no-longer-interested-3" class="deep-link"><a href="#why-im-no-longer-interested-3">Why I&apos;m no longer interested</a></h4>
<p>I don&apos;t believe it matters, because they can&apos;t be any worse than humans.</p>
<h2 id="continued-areas-of-interest" class="deep-link"><a href="#continued-areas-of-interest">Continued areas of interest</a></h2>
<h3 id="cheap-hardware-revolution" class="deep-link"><a href="#cheap-hardware-revolution">Cheap hardware revolution</a></h3>
<p>How can we best take advantage of game-changing cheap hardware, like the Kinect and Android phones?</p>
<h3 id="ubiquitous-computing" class="deep-link"><a href="#ubiquitous-computing">Ubiquitous Computing</a></h3>
<p>As the number of embedded computers increases, how can we keep the interface complexity from also increasing?</p>
<h3 id="disposable-computing" class="deep-link"><a href="#disposable-computing">Disposable Computing</a></h3>
<p>How cheap can computing get? Raspberry Pi Zero, unlimited free cloud deployments... could we start replacing our smartphones every week? Every day?</p>
