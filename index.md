**I'm a much better web developer than this site would suggest.** :smiley:
<br>I've just been working on cooler stuff than this site.

## What am I working on?

Currently I'm on a tooling binge. Check out:

- [update-readme](https://github.com/update-readme/update-readme) Auto-generate (and maintain!) your next README file
- [create-node-module](https://github.com/wmhilton/create-node-module#js) Refactor your code into lots of small modules, without the friction of set up that would slow you down
- [beautify](https://github.com/wmhilton/beautify) All code looks beautiful, once you've parsed its AST.

## What else?

- [webtorrent-button](https://github.com/wmhilton/download-with-webtorrent-button) Supercharge ordinary download links with WebTorrent P2P!
- [jus](https://github.com/jus/jus) I'm a contributor/maintainer
- [marky-markdown](https://github.com/npm/marky-markdown) I contributed the browserified bundle!
- [node-modules.io](https://node-modules.io) I maintain a site dedicated to npm alternatives and host my own registry mirror

## What's your secret master plan?

Elon Musk [had one](https://www.tesla.com/blog/secret-tesla-motors-master-plan-just-between-you-and-me).
My parents often wonder, [but I do have a plan](https://github.com/project-leibniz/master-plan).
(I also have a [5-year plan](https://github.com/wmhilton/modload#5-year-plan)!)


<hr>

My plan is to migrate content from <https://sites.google.com/site/wmhilton/home> over here, since Github is the place to be these days. That's been my plan since 2014 though so don't hold your breath. I should make that part of my 5-year plan.

Meanwhile, perhaps you'd like to peruse some of my code projects over at [@wmhilton](https://github.com/wmhilton)?
